## What is Continuum?
Continuum is a self-hosted, privacy-first dashboard that replaces a pile of single-purpose tracking apps — budget spreadsheet, Letterboxd, Goodreads, subscription reminders — with one place to manage expenses, investment portfolios, media watchlists, book libraries, and recurring subscriptions.<br/>It started as a personal API I fed into a Custom GPT so I could log expenses over chat instead of paying for another app. A friend wanted it too, so instead of handing over my personal API collection I built an actual dashboard around it. It's designed to natively integrate with AI assistants through a standardized OpenAPI schema.

## Technical Details

```
Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) + React 19 + TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Database & Auth: Firebase (Google Sign-In + Firestore REST API)
Architecture: Modular Domain-Driven Subdirectories (lib/audit-postback, lib/auth, lib/cron, lib/finance, lib/firebase, lib/integrations, lib/utils)
```

## Features
- Expense ledger with categorized transactions, location-specific currencies, and custom financial-period filtering.
- Investment portfolio tracking across equities, crypto, mutual funds/SIPs, gold, cash, and fixed deposits — manual entry or live valuation.
- Unified media watchlist with bidirectional AniList and Trakt sync, Letterboxd CSV imports, and metadata enrichment via OMDb and TVMaze.
- Book library backed by the OpenLibrary API with reading-progress tracking.
- Subscription tracker that normalizes monthly and annual costs into a true effective monthly spend.
- Auto-saving scratchpad for quick, persistent notes.
- Built-in OpenAPI 3.1 schema (`/api/openapi.json`) for Custom GPT Actions — add expenses, log media, or update your portfolio in plain English. Any other assistant with an equivalent OpenAPI-action builder works the same way; as of now that's Custom GPTs — Gemini Gems and Claude Projects don't expose one in their consumer UI.
- Real-time audit postback module (`lib/audit-postback/`) for login session auditing and Custom GPT action tracking.
- AES-256-GCM encryption on sensitive fields, with no admin service account — every request is authenticated with the caller's own Firebase ID token.

## Project Structure

```
lib/
├── audit-postback/    # Ingest client, session throttling, Custom GPT action detector
├── auth/              # Auth session, tokens, credentials, OAuth clients, unsubscribe logic
├── cron/              # Cron execution guards, scheduling, Discord alerting

└── utils/             # Dates, formatters, encryption, cache, redis, errors, route-handlers, site config
```

## Architecture

Every caller — a signed-in browser or an external AI client that completed the OAuth flow — ends up with the same kind of bearer token and hits the same API routes; there is no separate "AI" surface. Those routes read through an in-memory + Redis cache in front of Firestore, using the *caller's own* ID token, so per-user isolation is enforced by Firestore security rules rather than app code. Crons are the one exception: they have no user token to act with, so they carry a service account through the Admin SDK instead, which bypasses those same rules.

The other structural decision is that audit telemetry leaves the building entirely: `lib/domain-events` doesn't write to this app's own Firestore, it posts to **monolith-api**, a separate ingestion service that stores audit telemetry encrypted at rest in BigQuery for security auditing, analytics, and session telemetry. Route handlers also call out to Trakt, AniList, OMDb, and Gemini for sync, enrichment, and the AI assistant — plain leaf API calls shown alongside the core flow in the diagram below.

## Run Using Node.js

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fal3n-4ngel/Continuum-Home.git
cd Continuum-Home
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure Firebase

1. Create a project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Enable **Google Sign-in** under **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**.
3. Provision a **Firestore Database**.
4. **Project Settings** → **General** → **Add Web App** to generate the config snippet.
5. Deploy the security rules that isolate each user's data:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase use --add
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Set Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Set `FIREBASE_CONFIG` as a minified JSON string and pick an encryption key in `.env.local`:

```env
FIREBASE_CONFIG={"apiKey":"...","authDomain":"...","projectId":"..."}
ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-custom-super-secret-key-phrase"
```

Optional keys for Trakt, AniList, and OMDb can also go here — see [`.env.example`](.env.example).

> [!TIP]
> **Bring-your-own-config mode:** server-wide env vars for third-party APIs are optional. Users can instead supply their own credentials per-request via HTTP headers (`X-Firebase-Config`, `X-Trakt-Client-Id`, etc.) — see `lib/auth/credentials.ts`.

### Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run the Production Server

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Access the Website

Open your browser and navigate to

```bash
http://{ip}:3000
```

## 🔒 Security Model

- **No admin service account.** The backend never holds elevated database credentials — every write is routed through the [Firestore REST API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/use-rest-api), authenticated with the caller's own Firebase ID token.
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** on sensitive fields (titles, categories, amounts, notes) before they hit Firestore.
- **Per-user isolation** enforced by ownership checks in `firestore.rules`.
- **Hardened API routes** — payloads are validated at the boundary, and upstream proxy routes are strictly allowlisted against SSRF.

## 🤖 Talk to Continuum via ChatGPT

Continuum exposes an OpenAPI schema (`/api/openapi.json`) so you can add expenses, log media, or check your portfolio from a chat window instead of the UI. Requests originating from ChatGPT Actions are automatically detected (`isCustomGptRequest`) and recorded in audit telemetry.

### Official Public Custom GPT
Open the **[Continuum Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6a60b01e38c8819187662d1e42c6bee7-Continuum-Home-public)**. Authorization runs through standard OAuth 2.0 on your first prompt.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Configure a Custom GPT for your own self-hosted instance</strong></summary>

1. In ChatGPT: **Explore GPTs** → **Create** → **Configure** → **Actions**.
2. **Import Schema:** point it at `https://your-domain.com/api/openapi.json`.
3. **Configure Authentication** → **OAuth**:
   - **Client ID & Secret:** any dummy strings (e.g. `client` / `secret`).
   - **Authorization URL:** `https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/authorize`
   - **Token URL:** `https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/token`
   - **Token Exchange Method:** `Default (POST request)`.
4. **Instructions:** paste the contents of [CUSTOM_GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](CUSTOM_GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md).
5. Save and publish.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Portfolio / expense data won't decrypt, or looks garbled
- Symptoms
  + Fields render as blank or as raw ciphertext
  + Data written before now still won't read back correctly
- Troubleshooting Steps
  ```node
  # ENCRYPTION_KEY must stay identical for the lifetime of your data —
  # changing it makes everything encrypted under the old key unreadable.
  # Confirm .env.local matches what was used when the data was written.
  ```

### 2. Google Sign-in fails or Firestore requests get rejected
- Symptoms
  + Login redirects back to the login screen
  + API routes return 401/403
- Troubleshooting Steps
  ```node
  # Confirm Google Sign-in is enabled in Firebase Console → Authentication
  # Confirm `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` was run against the right project
  # Confirm FIREBASE_CONFIG in .env.local matches the same Firebase project
  ```

### 3. Daily cron emails / Custom GPT Actions aren't firing
- Symptoms
  + No daily portfolio/expense/subscription emails
  + Custom GPT Action calls fail silently
- Troubleshooting Steps
  ```node
  # Confirm CRON_SECRET and RESEND_API_KEY are set in your deployment env
  # Confirm the GitHub Actions cron workflows have APP_URL and CRON_SECRET as repo secrets
  # Check /api/cron/health for a live status check
  ```

## 🤖 Custom GPT Instructions & System Prompt

If you are setting up your own OpenAI Custom GPT or external assistant connected to Continuum via `/api/openapi.json`, use the following system prompt:

```text
Role and Purpose
You are the Continuum Assistant, an AI agent designed to help the user manage their finances, investments, subscriptions, and media watchlist. You are connected to the user's Continuum dashboard via an OpenAPI schema. Your goal is to seamlessly translate the user's natural language requests into API calls to track their life accurately.

Note: scratchpad notes are not reachable through this integration — there is no notes endpoint in the imported schema. If asked to read or save a note, say that's only available inside the dashboard's own AI assistant, not here.

Core Capabilities & API Mapping
You have access to several REST API endpoints. Use the following logic to determine which endpoint to call — but always defer to the actual operationId/schema in your imported Actions if anything here seems out of date.

1. Expenses (/api/expenses)
Logging: When the user says "I spent $20 on lunch" or "Log a $5 coffee expense", call the expense-creation action with title, amount, and category. Log incomes as negative (e.g. -100) so they net out correctly.
Listing/Analytics: If the user asks "How much did I spend this month?", list expenses (optionally filtered by from/to date) and sum the amounts yourself — there is no separate stats endpoint.
Modifying: If the user corrects an expense ("Change that lunch to $25"), patch that expense by id.
Deleting: If the user says "Delete that coffee expense", delete it by id.

2. Portfolio & Investments (/api/portfolio)
Categories: equity, crypto, mutual_fund, sip, gold, cash, fixed_deposit, other.
Buying/Adding: When the user says "I bought 10 shares of AAPL at $150", add a new asset with name, category, amount (current value), investedAmount (cost basis), quantity, and buyPrice.
  - For category "sip": quantity is the recurring installment amount in the user's currency, NOT a unit count — do not treat it as units held. amount is the total current valuation, which the user updates periodically; don't try to derive it by multiplying quantity by a price. If they give you a scheme name (e.g. "HDFC Mid Cap"), you may look it up via the portfolio symbol-search action to get an mfSchemeCode for live NAV tracking, plus optional startDate and sipDay (1-31, the debit day).
  - For category "fixed_deposit": use interestRate (annual %), startDate, maturityDate, and compounding (monthly/quarterly/half_yearly/yearly) instead of quantity/buyPrice.
Updating: If the user says "Update my AAPL average buy price to $145", patch that asset by id with the changed field(s) only.
Selling: If the user says "I sold my AAPL stock for $160", patch that asset by id and set isSold: true, soldPrice: 160, soldAt: <current time in ms>, and amount: 0. Sold assets are excluded from portfolio totals but stay visible in sold history — do not delete them.
Deleting: If the user says "Remove AAPL from my portfolio entirely" (not sold, just erased from records), delete it by id.
Note: there's also a full-replace action that overwrites the entire asset list at once — only use it for bulk operations, and always resend every existing field on every asset (including isSold/soldAt/soldPrice) since it's a full replace, not a patch. Prefer the single-asset patch/delete actions for anything about one holding.

3. Subscriptions (/api/subscriptions)
Tracking: For "Add my $15/month Netflix subscription", create a subscription with billingCycle: "monthly" and a nextBillingDate.
Updating/Canceling: Patch or delete it by id respectively.

4. Watchlist (/api/watchlist)
Adding Media: For "Add Inception to my watchlist", add an item with type: "movie" and status: "plan_to_watch".
Updating Progress: For "I finished season 1 of Breaking Bad", patch that item's progress or status (e.g. to "completed") by id.
Valid types: movie, show, anime, book. Valid statuses: plan_to_watch, watching, completed, dropped, paused.

Behavioral Guidelines
Be Concise and Action-Oriented: Do not give long-winded explanations. If the user asks you to log an expense, make the API call and confirm it briefly: "Logged $20 for Lunch."
Ask for Missing Context: If the user says "I bought TSLA" but doesn't provide the amount or buy price, politely ask for the missing details before making the API call.
Handle Errors Gracefully: If an API call fails, read the error message returned by the API and explain to the user what went wrong.
Confirm Destructive Actions: If the user asks to delete a major investment or wipe multiple records, ask for a quick confirmation before firing the delete action.
```

## 📝 Authors' Note

> Well, it's been a while since I worked on any public projects—mostly coz I rarely get time after work, and even when I do, it's usually personal APIs or portfolio updates.
>
> I already had a system to track my expenses and movies via my personal API, which I enhanced when ChatGPT released Custom GPTs so I could add stuff directly via chat (use AI without paying for an API). Instead of putting AI inside my API, I put my API inside AI (sounded cool in my head).
>
> Anyway, a friend saw it and wanted it too, so rather than handing over my personal API collection, I decided to build a proper dashboard instead. And here we are!

> Anyways, hosting a custom gpt is kinda costly so not sure how long I might keep that up, feel free to host your own one or sponsor me via the button below :)
